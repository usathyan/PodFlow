**Last updated:** December 23, 2024

## Overview

PodFlow is an open-source podcast player for Android. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data PodFlow accesses and how it is used.

## Data Collection

**PodFlow does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

All app data (subscriptions, playback progress, settings) is stored locally on your device and is never sent to external servers.

## Permissions

### Audio Recording Permission (RECORD_AUDIO)

PodFlow requests microphone/audio recording permission **solely** for the audio visualizer feature. This permission allows the app to:

- Capture audio output data to display real-time visualizations while playing podcasts
- The audio data is processed locally in real-time and is **never recorded, stored, or transmitted**

You can use PodFlow without granting this permission; only the visualizer feature will be unavailable.

### Storage Permission

## Third-Party Services

PodFlow connects to podcast hosting services to fetch RSS feeds and download episodes. These connections are made directly to the podcast publishers' servers. PodFlow does not use any analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
